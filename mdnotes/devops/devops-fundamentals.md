# Fundamentals Of DevOps

The goal of DevOps is to make software delivery vastly more efficient.

## Deploying an application

You can choose either *on prem*, *cloud*, or an *hybrid* environment that
combines both.

## PaaS and IaaS

*PaaS*: Takes care of most of the deployment for your app. Usually more
expensive, less flexibility and more limitations.

*IaaS*: Provides the enviornment, but you take care of the deployment. Less
expensive, more flexibility and less limitions. Harder to execute.

In general you should go PaaS when you can, transfer to IaaS when you need to.
