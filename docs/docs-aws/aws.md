## IAM

IAM Roles have a **permission policy** (what permissions are associated with the
role) and a **trust policy** (which principal can assume the role).

AWS STS (Security Token Service) is the backbone of how IAM Roles generate their
credentials.

Assuming and using a role requires a **session token** to be present.
