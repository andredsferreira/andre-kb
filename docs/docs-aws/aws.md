## IAM

IAM Roles have a **permission policy** (what permissions are associated with the
role) and a **trust policy** (which principal can assume the role).

AWS STS (Security Token Service) is the backbone of how IAM Roles generate their
credentials.

Assuming and using a role requires a **session token** to be present.

## VPC

By default a VPC comes with a **default route table** that allows traffic
between every node in the VPC.

AWS reserves 5 IP addresses per subnet, for example for 10.0.0.0/16:

- Network address: 10.0.0.0
- VPC Router: 10.0.0.1
- VPC DNS Server: 10.0.0.2
- Future use: 10.0.0.3
- Broadcast: 10.0.0.255 (subnets do not support broadcasting but AWS reserves
  this address)

Subnets can communicate with each other cross AZ (there is a cost associated
however).
