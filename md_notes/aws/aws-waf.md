# Pillars of the AWS Well Architected Framework

*Operational Excellence*: It's the overall operational excellence a service
reaches. It's met when all the other pillars are working perfectly for the
intended use case.

*Security*: Includes strategies like Defense in Depth, Principle of Least
Privelege (using AWS IAM).

*Realibility*: The most important pillar. It's the same as cloud service
availability, an SLA (Service Level Agreement) describes the consequences when a
provider doesn't meet the service-level objectives.

*Performance Efficiency*: 

*Cost Optimization*:


## Important SLI's (Service Level Indicators)

These SLI's are all related to the realibility pillar.

*Availability*: Amount of time service is available and usable.

*Latency*: The amount of time request can be fulfilled.

*Throughput*: The amount of data that's being processed per second (IO
operations per second).

*Durability*: The likelyhood data written to storage can be retreived in the
future.
